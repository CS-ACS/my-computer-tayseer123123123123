This computor was build by me during covid and it is very strong and can do everything that I use it for. My computer has 2T of SSD storage which is for the use of photoshop and other adobe products that have big files and export big files, I also have 16GB of Ram at a high speed because I usually run adobe products which are RAM intensive and I also run chrome and other programs in the background.![My Computer](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89731780/132344561-cb417099-e885-40b3-b31d-73a357882356.jpeg)
