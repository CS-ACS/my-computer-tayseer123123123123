# My Computer

In this assignment, you'll identify some of the major specs of your computer and present them using [Github Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/), which is a plain text format that allows formatted documents stored in plain text (rather than a special format like a Google doc, Microsoft Word Document, or Pages document) similar to HTML (which we'll explore further in the next assignemnt) but using simpler and more human-readable syntax.


## Computer Specs 
Describe each of the following aspects of your computer's hardware configuration. This should be (one of) the laptop or desktop computer(s) that you use the most.
* Brand and model name/number
* Operating System
* CPU
* RAM
* Storage (HDD/SSD/Flash/etc.)
* Wireless (Wi-Fi/Bluetooth)
